# Hands-on Docker-06 : Docker Compose Operations

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give the students understanding to Docker Compose.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- explain what Docker Compose is.

- install docker-compose-cli

- explain what the `docker-compose.yml` is.

- build a simple Python web application running on Docker Compose.

## Outline

- Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Part 2 - Installing Docker Compose

- Part 3 - Building a Web Application using Docker Compose

## Part 1 - Launch a Docker Machine Instance and Connect with SSH

- Launch a Docker machine on Amazon Linux 2 AMI with security group allowing SSH connections using the [Cloudformation Template for Docker Machine Installation](../docker-01-installing-on-ec2-linux2/docker-installation-template.yml).

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

## Part 2 - Installing Docker Compose

- For Linux systems, after installing Docker, you need install Docker Compose separately. But, Docker Desktop App for Mac and Windows includes `Docker Compose` as a part of those desktop installs.

- Download the current stable release of `Docker Compose` executable.

- Apply executable permissions to the binary:

- Check if the `Docker Compose`is working.

## Part 3 - Building a Web Application using Docker Compose

- Create a folder for the project:

- Create a file called `app.py` in your project folder and paste the following python code in it. In this example, the application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis, and  `redis` is the hostname of the `Redis container` on the applicationâ€™s network. We use the default port for Redis, `6379`.

```python
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)


def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)


@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
```

- Create another file called `requirements.txt` in your project folder, add `flask` and `redis` as package list.

- Create a Dockerfile which builds a Docker image and explain what it does.

- Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your project folder and define services and explain services.

- Build and run your app with `Docker Compose` and explains what is happening.

- Add a rule within the security group of Docker Instance allowing TCP connections through port `5000` from anywhere in the AWS Management Console.

- Enter http://`ec2-host-name`:5000/ in a browser to see the application running.

- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop containers, and run `docker ps -a` to see containers created by Docker Compose.

- Remove the containers with `Docker Compose`.
